# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Practice Projects

This repository contains all of my hands-on work from machine learning lessons and self-study. It includes implementations of both **supervised** and **unsupervised learning** techniques, written in Python using libraries such as `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`.
